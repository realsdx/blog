## Introduction
Email is the most widely used professional communication medium on the internet. However, it is not the fully reliable medium. Today’s standard email transmission protocol, SMTP was created in 1982  with no authentication of the sender in mind. Probably,  then no one thought about hackers. But now the situation has changed.

Email spoofing basically means sending emails with fake/forged sender address. For example, an email can be spoofed to appear as it came from *'no-reply@accounts.google.com’*.
